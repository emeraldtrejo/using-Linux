#Since oldFiles.txt is passed as a command line argument, it's stored in the variable sys.argv[1]. 
#Open the file from the first argument to read its contents using open() method. 
#You can either assign it to a variable or use a with block. 
#Hint: traverse each line in the file using readlines() method. 
#Use line.strip() to remove any whitespaces or newlines and fetch the old name.

#Once you have the old name, use replace() function to replace "jane" with "jdoe". 
#This method replaces occurrences of any older substring with the new substring. 
#The old and new substrings are passed as parameters to the function.
#Therefore, it returns a string where all occurrences of the old substring is replaced with the new substring
